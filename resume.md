Strategic, innovation-driven technology leader with over two decades of experience delivering complex, high-impact technology initiatives across banking, financial services, and telecommunications sectors.

Proven track record in leading enterprise-scale programs from concept to execution, with deep expertise in technical project management, software development, process optimisation, and operational efficiency. Adept at managing multi-million-dollar portfolios, overseeing Agile and DevOps-driven deliveries, and implementing automation, CI/CD pipelines, and analytics solutions that enhance speed, compliance, and quality.
